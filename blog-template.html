<!-- Reflect

How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

It was fun. We had a lot of hiccups on the way with getting the div content to work right, but; we were able to do a simple segmenting.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

Yes, wireframing helped us visualize what we were going to create.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 

The content should be easier to look at. Things should be simple and precise.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

I learned to manipulate div boxes to create sections. 

The blog wire template we used was: https://github.com/DannyHwangCA/DannyHwangCA.github.io/blob/master/imgs/blogtemplate.png
