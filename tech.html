<h4> Review of Recursion and its role in our computing world! </h4>
In this post, we're reviewing recursion and it's role and uses in our modern computing world.

<h3> What is recursion? </h3>
Recursion is a method where the solution for a problem can be derived from smaller processed instances of that same problem. 
<br><br>
Some programs use functional programming languages that do not use looping to solve problems but instead use recursion to call and process code 
<br><br>
These languages can solve the same problems as more commonly used imperative languages without using iteration constructs such as "while" or "for".
<br><br>
That being said, most languages do support both recursion and looping as acceptable code by allowing a function to call itself. 

<h3> What does recursion do for computer programming?</h3>

A common recursion technique in programming is to divide a problem into sub-problems that are similar to the original.
<br><br>
Using this method, the divide-and conquer method, we solve the sub-problems and combine the results. 
<br><br>
If we store the results of these subproblems in a table, this is then called dynamic programming or memoization, which, is an optimization technique used to pulled stored results from a cache of results from complex calculations.
<br><br>
In turn, a recursive functionâ€™s role is to break down complex inputs into simpler ones.  

<h3> Are there different types of recursions? </h3>
Recursions that contain only a single self reference is a single recursion. Similarly, recursions with multiple self references are known as multiple recursions. 
<br><br>
Common single recursions types in the modern world are linear searches, factorial compuatations, and processing list traversals. 
<br><br>
Common multiple recursions types are depth first searches and tree traversal (which is a process that checks and processes nodes in a tree data structure) a single time.).
<br><br>
Additionally, there are also direct and indirect recursions.
<br><br>
The most common type of recursion are direct recursions. Direct recursions are where the functions calls itself. 
<br><br>
Indirect recursions occurs when a function is not called by itself but by another function. Indirect recursions are also known as mutual recursions.  
<br><br>
I hope this has given you more insight into the uses of recursions within the modern world.
