        Hello all! 
        <br><br>
        In this first blog post, I am going to review what I learned this 1st week of dev bootcamp!

      <b> What are the benefits of version control? </b>
      <br>
      The benefits of version control are:
      <br>
          <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Effient Storage:</b> Version control gives us a structure to store our saved versions of a file more efficiently. If we had to save a different versions of the file in a folder, it would become messy.... FAST.
            </li> 
            <li>
                <b>Restoring Versions:</b> Version control enables us to set different versions of out work. This enables us to backtrack our code and work from a more stable version of the code if the need arises.
            </b>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Back up versions:</b> If a whole community/team uses version control to work on one project. Then, if a major catastrophe occurs, at least one member should have a stable working copy of the project. 
            </li> 
          </ol>
        
      </p>

         <b> How does git help you keep track of changes?</b>
         <br> <br>
            Git helps us track changes by allowing us to make changes to a file on our desired editor of choice (sublime) and then keeps track of those changes for us.
            <br> <br>
            Git provides a master branch from which we can create a "feature" branch to make our changes on. This separation of branches enables multiple people to make changes on a file before "merging" the changes of each branch back to a master branch. All we have to do is keep the different changes on different branches. 
            <br> <br>
            Git then gives us the means to "commit" or store changed versions of the file locally, and then; we can "push" or upload those changes onto a remote repository site (like Github). 
            <br> <br>
            This creates locally stored versions of the file as well as a remotely stored versions.  
      </p>

         <b>
            Why use GitHub to store your code?
         </b>
            <br> <br>
            We use Github to store our code and the many different versions of the code in a remote location / Github servers / cloud. 
            <br> <br>
            By having our files and versions on Github, we can have our team or a community work on the code while we supervise the revision of the code through submitted versions of the code via reviewing "pull requests" or formal code change review requests.
            <br> <br>
            Github also enables us to "fork" or copy a file or code and work on it at our own location. This enables us to retreive the code/file from anywhere in the world.  
            <br> <br>
            Github also keep a log of all the changes pushed ot the repository. This enables greater control over revisions to the master file!
