Reflection for 3.5

What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

I learened so much. 

First off, I used most margin: auto or specific percentages to create a responsive site. 

I used padding to crete responsive boxes for buttons based on font size.

I used borders to create lines and additional spacing for each object. 

What did you learn about CSS positioning?

I learned that float left can be stacked twice to create side by side objects. 

Also, you can use clear:both the enable an object to avoid overlapping other objects above it. 

I learned that percentages can be used to create sites responsive to the size of the user's monitor and web browser. 

Also, I learned we can use negative white space to create lines by spacing the objects properly with margin and etc. 

What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

The easiest to implement were the buttons. I created many buttons using css border and border radius, pairing it with a shadow and background color.

The most difficult was to get the margins exactly right for the site. I kept going back and forth adjusting code to get it exactly correct.

What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

I learned to use all the font family, size, and color to create a visually appealing text style. 

I learned to use divs to create lines if needed and to create the overall containers for my text. 

I also learened that adjusting padding within the text area can help adjust the overall feel of the site by aligning the text properly.
